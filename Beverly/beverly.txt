Maven and Gradle

Both are build tools.

Apache first released “Apache Ant” in 2000, which is the predecessor for Maven. Maven was formally introduced in 2002, and a v1 release occurred in 2000, and a v2 release in 2005. The most modern day version (v3) of Maven was released in 2010. 
Gradle’s was first developed in 2008, and it’s v1 release was 2012. Between 2012, and 2021, a number of version releases have occurred, with the most recent 2021 being version 7. Gradle is also know for being incorporated into Android builds, as of 2013. 
Maven has it’s default directory structure in Java projects. It runs within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and it’s core functionality builds Java applications only. Likewise, Gradle runs inside the JVM.

Differences include:

1. Projects can be built on the Maven command line interface in a standard way, using the Maven lifecycle. WHEREAS, Gradle’s build model if quite modifiable directly from the build script. So an additional plugin is not needed to build logic on the fly.

2. Maven creates build artifacts within a target directory, whereas Gradle uses a build directory.
